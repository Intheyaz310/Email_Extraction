# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy Your React App to GitHub Pages

### Current Setup
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow configured (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- âœ… Build process automated
- âœ… Uses official GitHub Actions deployment method
- âœ… Proper permissions configured

### Deployment Process

1. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Every push to `main` branch triggers deployment
   - GitHub Actions builds your React app
   - Uses official `actions/deploy-pages@v4` action
   - No permission issues with this method

2. **Manual Deployment**
   - Run `.\build-for-github-pages.bat` to build locally
   - Push changes to trigger automatic deployment

### GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Intheyaz310/Email_Extraction`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section
4. Set **Source** to: **GitHub Actions**
5. This will automatically use the workflow we configured

### Your Site URL
Your site will be available at:
`https://intheyaz310.github.io/email_extraction/`

### Troubleshooting

**If you get permission errors:**
- The new workflow uses `actions/deploy-pages@v4` which handles permissions automatically
- No need for manual token configuration
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

**If the site doesn't load:**
- Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if deployment succeeded
- Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
- Make sure the repository name is correct: `Email_Extraction`

### Files Explained

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow using official deployment method
- `.nojekyll` - Tells GitHub Pages not to use Jekyll processing
- `build-for-github-pages.bat` - Local build script
- `netlify.toml` - Alternative deployment to Netlify (if needed)

### Key Changes Made

1. **Updated to official GitHub Actions deployment method**
2. **Added proper permissions configuration**
3. **Fixed repository name reference**
4. **Removed dependency on third-party actions**
